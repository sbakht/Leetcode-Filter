# Leetcode Filter

I don't have a premium subscription to https://leetcode.com which has locked problems for subscribers. The problems are still shown in the problem set for people without subscriptions. 

This small chrome extension creates a toggle button underneath the dropdown filter to show/hide premium questions.
